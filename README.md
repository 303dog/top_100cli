# top_100cli
CLI project providing the top 100 movies

After cloning the top_100cli repo into your editor, type 'cd top_100gem' into the terminal to access the correct file.  Then type 'bin/console' to start the program.

cd top_100gem
bin/console


I am putting the final touches on my CLI project.  I had to make a new 
repo in github because the old version was throwing an error :fatal: could not parse HEAD, after googling my options and not understanding what was being told, i decided to just create a new one. however- now I am having problems commiting to the new repo.  I must be doing something wrong but I am not sure what it is. I am going to test the program to make sure it is working correctly.  cool, it still works. now I need to figure out the issue with commit.

seems as though I was in the wrong file and that is why I couldnt commit. After changing the file from top_100gem to top_100cli everything commited just fine. noted. Now I will try to pull the repo into a new file to see if it is usable to other people.
