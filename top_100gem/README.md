# top_100cli

Top_100Cli is a CLI program that uses Nokogiri & open-uri to scrape Imbd.com for the top 100 films of all time. By prompting the user with specific menus to help navigate them through the process, the user is able to not only see the complete list of 100 movies but also select the movie of their choice to have the program gather and produce detailed data on that chosen title.


To run the program, type `bin/run` into your terminal for an interactive prompt.
